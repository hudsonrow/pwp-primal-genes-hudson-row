<h1>Purpose, Audience, Goal</h1>
    <p>The <strong>PURPOSE</strong> of this project is to create a website that can direct people to Primal Genes coaching information, provide their contact information and socials, and to boast accomplishments to show why they are the right fit to train someone.</p>
    <p>The <strong>AUDIENCE</strong> of this website will be clients looking for coaching, organizers of events looking for people to sponsor, people who need information about trail running or what their brand does.</p>
    <p>The <strong>GOAL</strong> of this project is to grow the business (Primal Genes) and provide a professional and pleasant to use website. I want it to be used as something that will help my friends get more clients. It is also to highlight my abilities to develop, wireframe, structure, and complete a project of this manor. </p>
