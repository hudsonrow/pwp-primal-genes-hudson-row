<h1> Purpose, Audience, Goal</h1>
    <p>The <strong>PURPOSE</strong> of this project is to create a website that can direct people to Primal Genes coaching information and to boast accomplishments to show why they are the right fit to train someone.</p>
    <p>The <strong>AUDIENCE</strong> of this website will be clients looking for coaching, organizers of events looking for people to sponsor, people who need information about trail running or what their brand does.</p>
    <p>The <strong>GOAL</strong> of this project is to grow the business (Primal Genes) and provide a professional and pleasant to use website. I want it to be used as something that will help my friends get more clients. It is also to highlight my abilities to develop, wireframe, structure, and complete a project of this manor. </p>
