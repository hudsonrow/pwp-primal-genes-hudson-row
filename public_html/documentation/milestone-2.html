    <h1>Content Strategy</h1>
    <p>At the heading of the website features 4 link tags. Each tag will be clickable and will scroll the page down to the corresponding section. </p>
    <p>The section right underneath the nav bar will feature text, along with a background of photos that will be static until the user clicks to the next one. There will be arrow tags at the bottom of the photo that will move to the next frame.</p>
    <p>I want to implement a hover feature over the services pictures that will give a description of the type of training.</p>
    <p>The testimonial section will be static with a quote and picture of the person giving the testimonial. I want this section to be digestible.</p>
    <p>Lastly I decided not to do a message box for contact information (friends request) but I will be adding their emails and social media accounts (embedded links). </p>
